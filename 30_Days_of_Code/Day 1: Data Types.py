#Task
#Complete the code in the editor below. The variables , , and are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
#Declare variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
#Read lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your variables.
#Use the operator to perform the following operations:
#Print the sum of plus your int variable on a new line.
#Print the sum of plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
#Concatenate with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line. 

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
i2 = 12
d2 = 4.0
s2 = 'is the best place to learn and practice coding!'

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
i3 = int(input())
d3 = float(input())
s3 = input()

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(i+i3)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(d+d3)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s+s3)

# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
